### SpaceBones - The Quest for More Yummies

Now that you have mastered the skill of installing & configuring Docker, as well as launching containers, it is now time to test your skill even further by launching a website for the nation of Spacebones. Use the preconfigured DockerHub  `spacebones/doge`  image to deploy the website on port 80. Lastly, be sure to name the container  `treatseekers`, for organizational purposes. Good luck, brave one!

## Additional Information and Resources

Now that you have mastered the skill of installing & configuring Docker as well as launching containers, it is now time to test your skill even further by launching a website for the nation of SpaceBones.

Use the preconfigured DockerHub  [spacebones/doge](https://hub.docker.com/r/spacebones/doge/)  image to deploy the website in detached mode, redirecting the container HTTP service on port 80 to the underlying host port 80 (so we can test the website). Lastly, be sure to name the container  `treatseekers`, for identification purposes. Good luck, brave one!
