### SpaceBones 2 - The Quest for More Yummies

Hello & welcome to your first challenge in  _The Quest for More Yummies_. In this challenge, you are tasked with preparing your environment for maximum snack acquisition for the people of SpaceBones by installing docker, then acquiring the following images from DockerHub:

-   hello-world
-   06kellyjac/nyancat
-   jeremy646/doge

Once the images have been downloaded, test your Docker installation by running the  `hello-world`  image. Don't forget to add correct permissions for the  `cloud_user`  user!  `cloud_user`  should be able to access Docker without using  `sudo`. Good luck!
