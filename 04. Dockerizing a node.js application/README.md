### Dockerizing a Node.js Application

Welcome back, and great job on migrating the SpaceBones website from NGINX to Apache! President Squawk is very impressed with your skill, and now has another task lined up. As you probably noticed from the current national website, SpaceBones is not only in need of treats, but also in need of a bit of technological advancement.

The Radar Board (The official SpaceBones government tech team) has requested your assistance with developing a Node.js web application that can be used for launching a new and improved SpaceBones webspace.

## Additional Information and Resources

The Radar Board (The official SpaceBones government tech team) have requested your assistance with developing a Node.js web application that can be used for launching a new and improved SpaceBones webspace. They have provided all of the basic files in the  [content-dockerquest-spacebones](https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-dockerquest-spacebones)  Github. Using the example  `Dockerfile`  included in activity instructions, use Docker to build a new  `Node.js`  app image using the files under the  `content-dockerquest-spacebones/nodejs-app`  subdirectory, named  `baconator`. Be sure to tag the image as  `dev`. Good luck!
