## Description

### Container Networking with Links

It's all about networking! For this activity, President Squawk has requested your aid in creating a super-duper secret network for transport of secure information between the official  `SpaceBones`  website & database. As our resident Docker expert, use legacy  `Docker links`  to create a linked network between  `SpaceBones:thewebsite`  & the  `treatlist`  Postgres database.

## Additional Information and Resources

Create a network link between the two Docker containers,  `spacebones:thewebsite`  &  `treatlist`  using legacy  `Docker links`. Use the image found at  `spacebones/postgres`to create the database.
