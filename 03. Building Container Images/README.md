## Description

Welcome back! President Squawk extends his deep gratitude for your assistance with launching the SpaceBones website in the previous activity using the existing image provided, but as a Red Hat Fanbird he has requested that the site be migrated to an RPM environment -- specifically  `CentOS 6`.

Because of your stellar performance so far, The President has requested that you handle the migration & create a new image.

## Additional Information and Resources

In this activity, you are tasked with migrating the SpaceBones official Government website from Ubuntu to CentOS 6 by preparing a CentOS 6 image found on DockerHub to run Apache.

Use the website contents found in the  [content-dockerquest-spacebones](https://github.com/linuxacademy/content-dockerquest-spacebones/)  GitHub repository (specifically contents found under the  `/doge/`  directory) to recreate the website on CentOS. Good luck!
