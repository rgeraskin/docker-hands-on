## Description

For the last six months, the Acme Anvil Corporation has been migrating some of their bare metal infrastructure to Docker containers. Itâ€™s time to implement some basic monitoring in the environment. You will handle this in two ways: using  `Docker stats`  and Prometheus. Your mission is to set up Prometheus and cAdvisor using Docker Compose.

You can get more information on Prometheus at  [prometheus.io](https://prometheus.io/).

## Additional Information and Resources

In this learning activity, you will monitor containers using  `Docker stats`, Prometheus, and cAdvisor.

#### Part 1: Using Prometheus

1.  Create a  `prometheus.yml`  file that contains the  `cadvisor`  job.
2.  Set the scrape interval to  `5 seconds`.
3.  Target  `cadvisor`  on port 8080.
4.  Create a Docker Compose file and use Version 3.
5.  The first service will be called  `prometheus`.
6.  Use  `prom/prometheus:latest`  for the image.
7.  Name the container  `prometheus`.
8.  Map port 9090 to 9090 on the container.
9.  Set the command to  `--config.file=/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`.
10.  Create a volume that maps  `prometheus.yml`  to  `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`. Make the volume read-only.
11.  Make sure it depends on the cAvisor container.
12.  Create a second service called  `cadvisor`.
13.  Use  `google/cadvisor:latest`  for the image.
14.  Name the container  `cadvisor`.
15.  Map port 8080 to 8080 on the container.
16.  Create the following volumes:
    -   `/`  maps to  `/rootfs`  (make it read-only)
    -   `/var/run`  maps to  `/var/run`  (make it read-write)
    -   `/sys`  maps to  `/sys`  (make it read-only)
    -   `/var/lib/docker/`  maps to  `/var/lib/docker`  (make it read-only)
17.  Execute a  `docker-compose up`.
18.  Make sure the container is running in the background.

#### Part 2: Using  `Docker stats`

There are two containers already running in your live environment:  `nginx`  and  `redis`.

1.  Create a shell script in your  `root`  directory called  `stats.sh`.
2.  Make sure the script is executable.
3.  In the file, add a line that will execute the  `Docker stats`  command using the  `formatting`  flag with the name, ID, memory usage, and CPU percentage placeholders.
4.  Make sure the output is formatted as a table.
5.  Execute  `stats.sh`  to view the results.
6.  When you're finished, exit the results.
